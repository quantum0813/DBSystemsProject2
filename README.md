# Simple PHP CRUD Model

This is a very simple CRUD model (create, read, update, delete) written in PHP with some JavaScript in there also.
It uses a MySQL database at the backend to store the data.
It shows a simple table of users, and allows you to add, update and delete them.

Once the project is setup with an Apache webserver, MySQL database and a PHP interpreter, you can run the
`user_list.php` file in any browser.
